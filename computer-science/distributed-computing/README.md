2. [Distributed data store (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_store)
    - A distributed data store is a computer network where information is stored on
      more than one node, often in a replicated fashion.
    - It is usually specifically used to refer to either a distributed database where
      users store information on a number of nodes, or a computer network in which
      users store information on a number of peer network nodes.
3. [CAP theorem (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)
    - States that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously
      provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability,
      Partition tolerance.

    - Spanner is Google's highly available global-scale distributed database. It
      provides strong consistency for all transactions.
