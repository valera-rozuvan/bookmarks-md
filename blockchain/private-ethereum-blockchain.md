3. [Setting up private network or local cluster](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster)
    - This page describes how to set up a local cluster of nodes, advise how to make it
      private, and how to hook up your nodes on the eth-netstat network monitoring app.
    - A fully controlled ethereum network is useful as a backend for network integration
      testing (core developers working on issues related to networking/blockchain
      synching/message propagation, etc or DAPP developers testing multi-block and multi-user scenarios).
4. [Private network](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Private-network)
    - An Ethereum network is a private network if the nodes are not connected to the main network nodes.
    - In this context private only means reserved or isolated, rather than protected or secure.
